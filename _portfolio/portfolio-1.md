## Description
Our project is to create an app for the True Force Technologies Force Rack. Using the True Force products, coaches can safely measure their athletesâ€™ strength and performance. The app displays data collected from the weight rack. It can also be used to view information from previous lifts to compare and measure improvement. Third-party developers originally developed an app that did not meet our client's needs, so he requested our team to make a new one for him. We initially created two separate apps for iOS and Android, but have since switched to creating one React Native app. 

A good app needs proper security protections, which include secure login functionality, limited vulnerabilities, and a protected database. Due to the client still using the old application and an existing contract protecting the source code and database, we were unable to implement security features into the existing application. However, we have found a future solution using Microsoft Azure and worked on outlining its features in a document that we are giving to our client. 

## My Role
Cyber Security Co-Master

My job is to research security solutions for the current application. Because the implementation of the application and database did not allow for us to introduce any new security features, we decided to research new technologies that can be used once the app that my team made is being used. Our solution for the client is to use Microsoft Azure, so we created a document containing an outline of the security features and instructions on how to configure a database. 

## Skills or knowledge gained
* Familiarity with various cloud-based security solutions
* Working directly with industry clients 

## Supporting documents
Our documentation and reports can be found on [our website](https://sdmay25-10.sd.ece.iastate.edu/). 

## Big picture contribution 
The app will still need a lot of work after we are done working on it. However, we have made a good foundation for future senior design teams to keep working on the product. The security document that the other security Co-Master, Elicia, and I created outlines how a future team can set up the security once the app is ready for it. Our work is the first step to creating a more secure True Force app.
