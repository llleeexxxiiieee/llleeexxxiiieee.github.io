## Description
The goal of this project was to mimic the behavior of a CD player. This is a project that needed to use a finite state machine and a register file as well as the inputs and displays on the boards in the lab. In order to achieve this, I used the knowledge that I have acquired from the CPR E 281 class throughout the semester and the tools in the lab. The project is implemented through the use of BDFs developed in Quartus Prime. It utilizes five seven-segment displays to show the track number and time elapsed of a particular song. Various buttons and switches on the board are used to set and control the CD. The deliverable is an unfinished CD player that can take some input but does not display the expected result. It is a decent start to a project that can be further developed and improved.

## My Role
Lead Designer and Developer

Because this was a solo project, I was responsible for designing and developing the entire project. This included picking what I wanted to make, which was a CD player inspired by my love for music. The design process involved sketching the designs and state machines on paper. Once I was happy with my designs, I created the parts in Quartus Prime and connected them together. Finally, I tested my work on the FPGAs in the lab and made any necessary adjustments to my logic circuits.
