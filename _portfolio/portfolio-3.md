## Description
This was the final project for CPRE 2810: Digital Logic. The goal of this project was to mimic the behavior of a CD player. This is a project that needed to use a finite state machine and a register file as well as the inputs and displays on the boards in the lab. In order to achieve this, I used the knowledge that I have acquired from the CPR E 281 class throughout the semester and the tools in the lab. The project is implemented through the use of BDFs developed in Quartus Prime. It utilizes five seven-segment displays to show the track number and time elapsed of a particular song. Various buttons and switches on the board are used to set and control the CD. The deliverable is an unfinished CD player that can take some input but does not display the expected result. It is a decent start to a project that can be further developed and improved.
