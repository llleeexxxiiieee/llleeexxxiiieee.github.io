## Description
In today's fast-paced fashion industry, many individuals need help identifying clothing colors that complement their unique skin tones, often leading to unsatisfactory wardrobe choices and a lack of confidence in their style. Moreover, in-person color consultations' high cost and inconvenience present significant barriers for those seeking practical advice. Our app addresses these issues by providing a convenient, cost-effective solution that leverages technology to analyze users' skin undertones through image processing. The app offers personalized color recommendations to enhance individual style choices. Additionally, the app fosters a community of fashion-forward users by enabling the sharing of user-curated outfits, therefore offering a free alternative to traditional color consulting services.

## My Role
Front-End Developer

My role in the project involved developing the application's front-end, which is what the user interacts with. I created screens, designed screen layouts, and implemented buttons and other UI functionality. Another part of front-end development I did was format HTTP requests with user information to send to the back-end to be stored. An example of this is the process I created for posting a photo on the app. The user selects the photo that they want to post and adds a caption using the app’s UI. Then when they hit a “post” button, the program sends a POST request to the back-end with data from the user, such as their username, photo, and caption. Then when the user goes to their profile, they can see the posts they made because a GET request is sent to the back-end to get all the posts.
