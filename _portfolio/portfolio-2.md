## Description
In today's fast-paced fashion industry, many individuals need help identifying clothing colors that complement their unique skin tones, often leading to unsatisfactory wardrobe choices and a lack of confidence in their style. Moreover, in-person color consultations' high cost and inconvenience present significant barriers for those seeking practical advice. Our app addresses these issues by providing a convenient, cost-effective solution that leverages technology to analyze users' skin undertones through image processing. The app offers personalized color recommendations to enhance individual style choices. Additionally, the app fosters a community of fashion-forward users by enabling the sharing of user-curated outfits, therefore offering a free alternative to traditional color consulting services.
