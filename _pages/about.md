Hi! My name is Alexandra Rauer, and I am currently studying Cyber Security Engineering and German at Iowa State University. After I graduate in May, I will work at Kingland as an Advanced Cyber Security Intern. In the fall, I will continue my studies at ISU, pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Cyber Security with a creative component.
