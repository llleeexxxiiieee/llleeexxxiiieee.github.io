I interned at Optum for three summers as a Technology Development Intern. It is a 10-week program where small teams of interns work on projects and present their solutions and progress to company leadership and other intern teams. My internships at Optum allowed me to meet many different people, work in multiple departments, and experience the corporate culture of a Fortune 5 company. 

## Duties and Projects
### Analyzing the Software Development Lifecycle (Summer 2023)
In my last summer internship at Optum, I was on a team that mostly shadowed a software engineering team to learn about the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It involves Agile methodologies, meaning we wrote user stories and participated in daily scrum and bi-weekly retrospective meetings. We also got to participate in all-day coding events with the software engineers when they needed to make improvements to the products. Overall, it was a much less technical experience than my previous internships, which I was disappointed by, and therefore decided not to return for another summer after the internship was over.
### Developed a web app to monitor status of company devices (June 2022 - May 2023)
During my second internship at Optum I was on a team with two other interns. Our job was to create a web app to monitor the status of various company-owned devices. The data collection from the devices was already managed, so it was our job to create something to display their status and test the application. We used Django to create a web application to display the status of three different device types, laptops, desktops, and Raspberry Pis. The testing was initially done using Django test cases but we eventually moved to using Docker containers for testing. Our manager valued our contributions and extended our internship through the school year so we were able to continue working on the application before it would be passed along to another team. 
### Automating the contract transcribing process (Summer 2021)
My first summer at Optum was done completely remote and I worked on a team with three other interns. Our job was to prototype an automated process for transcribing the information in health insurance contracts into data tables used. The original process was done manually by someone individually reading through the contract and inputting the information into the internal application. We used an optical character recognition (OCR) tool to extract the text from the PDF contracts into JSON and then parse the data using Python. I analyzed the way that the OCR tool put the data into the JSON files and reformatted that data in Python into tables to match the tables in the application used by the contract team.

## Skills learned
* Developed the web application using Django
* Parsed and formatted JSON data with Python
* Tested the application with the help of Docker containers

## Evaluations
All of my managers were pleased with my work, which is shown by my receiving returning offers for two summers and being asked to work through a school year.

## Presentations
The presentations for the internships had a “Shark Tank” model for presentations. We would give four presentations throughout the summer, pitching our project, giving progress updates, and demoing the final product for a panel of “sharks” who were leaders in the organization.
