As a graduation requirement for my second major, I had to do an internship in German, so I decided to apply to the UROP program at RWTH Aachen University. It is a program for North American students to research at their university for ten weeks, learn German, and explore the area near Aachen. I had a transformative experience abroad, learned a lot, and was able to meet many people from all over the world. 

## Duties and Projects
My project was to test open-source user equipment (UE) security in a 5G network. I created test cases by modifying Non-Access Stratum (NAS) messages between the UE and the Core Network. The tests were to see if the UE would accept misconfigured NAS messages. An example would be if the incoming message said that it should send packets without encryption, and the UE responded to that misconfigured NAS message, it would imply a security issue, as that would result in communicating without encryption. I wrote a paper and made a poster outlining the work.

## Skills learned
* Worked in a research lab environment and presented at a symposium 
* Tested UEs using Open5GS and srsRAN
* Analyzed packet captures using Wireshark

## Evaluations
I received a grade of 1.3 in the German grading system (comparable to an A-) for my project.

## Presentations
About halfway through the summer, we had internal team presentations. I told the team about my project, why I was doing it, and any progress I had made. I created a PowerPoint presentation and answered questions from my lab team. 

At the end of the summer, there was a symposium for all the students in the UROP program. For this event, I created a poster, explained my project to a more general audience, and answered questions about my experience.
